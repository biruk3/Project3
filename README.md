# Project3
For the flowcharts we created four scenarios in which we can catch an illegal login attempt. The first one is if the user tried to login more than five in a single day if yes we reject the attempt to log in. The other scenario is also if the user tried to login between 12 to 5 am. 
For the second scenario is the number of logins more than the number of logouts. If yes we create a report of time, activiy and server information in ascending order based on time. 
For the third scenario is if the number logouts more than the number of logins. If yes we create a report for system glither report time, activity, server in ascending order based on time. 
For the fourth scenario is by using the dot split to get the domain name from the email and create a report of the domain name.
